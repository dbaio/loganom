**loganom** is a tool that checks mail log files in search of anomalies.

The first processor check postfix sasl authentication.

Usually, when an account is compromised, attackers use several machines from
their botnets to send emails (spam/virus/phishing/etc) with that credential.

This can be observed when a user who usually connects from the same country
suddenly sends emails from worldwide.

See more about in the :doc:`processor` section.

This is an *experimental* program.
